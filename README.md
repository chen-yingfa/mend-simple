# Simple MEND

An implementation of MEND:

Model Editor Networks with Gradient Decomposition (`mend`): Mitchell et al. [[Code]](https://github.com/eric-mitchell/mend) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11309)

But the official repo is WAY TOO COMPLICATED, so I implemented this.

### Training

Most hyperparameters can be specified in the constructor of the `EditorTrainer`, but some are hard-coded as well. All hyperparameters are set according to the official repo.

```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluation

Upcoming.
